"bash","low","low","5.0-4",,false,"## NVD Description
**_Note:_** _Versions mentioned in the description apply to the upstream `bash` package._

An issue was discovered in disable_priv_mode in shell.c in GNU Bash through 5.0 patch 11. By default, if Bash is run with its effective UID not equal to its real UID, it will drop privileges by setting its effective UID to its real UID. However, it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systems that support &#34;saved UID&#34; functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with command execution in the shell can use &#34;enable -f&#34; for runtime loading of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls setuid() and therefore regains privileges. However, binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are unaffected.
## Remediation
There is no fixed version for `Debian:10` `bash`.

**_Note:_** _Versions mentioned in the description apply to the upstream `dpkg` package._
_See `How to fix?` for `Debian:10` relevant versions._

Dpkg::Source::Archive in dpkg, the Debian package management system, before version 1.21.8, 1.20.10, 1.19.8, 1.18.26 is prone to a directory traversal vulnerability. When extracting untrusted source packages in v2 and v3 source package formats that include a debian.tar, the in-place extraction can lead to directory traversal situations on specially crafted orig.tar and debian.tar tarballs.
## Remediation
Upgrade `Debian:10` `dpkg` to version 1.19.8 or higher.

**_Note:_** _Versions mentioned in the description apply to the upstream `expat` package._

expat 2.1.0 and earlier does not properly handle entities expansion unless an application developer uses the XML_SetEntityDeclHandler function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption), send HTTP requests to intranet servers, or read arbitrary files via a crafted XML document, aka an XML External Entity (XXE) issue.  NOTE: it could be argued that because expat already provides the ability to disable external entity expansion, the responsibility for resolving this issue lies with application developers; according to this argument, this entry should be REJECTed, and each affected application would need its own CVE.

**_Note:_** _Versions mentioned in the description apply to the upstream `gcc-8` package._

The POWER9 backend in GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) before version 10 could optimize multiple calls of the __builtin_darn intrinsic into a single call, thus reducing the entropy of the random number generator.

**_Note:_** _Versions mentioned in the description apply to the upstream `glibc` package._

An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the &#39;num&#39; parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the &#39;num&#39; parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.

There is no fixed version for `Debian:10` `glibc`.

"gzip","high","high","1.9-3",,false,"## NVD Description
**_Note:_** _Versions mentioned in the description apply to the upstream `gzip` package._
_See `How to fix?` for `Debian:10` relevant versions._

An arbitrary file write vulnerability was found in GNU gzip&#39;s zgrep utility. When zgrep is applied on the attacker&#39;s chosen file name (for example, a crafted file name), this can overwrite an attacker&#39;s content to an arbitrary attacker-selected file. This flaw occurs due to insufficient validation when processing filenames with two or more newlines where selected content and the target file names are embedded in crafted multi-line file names. This flaw allows a remote, low privileged attacker to force zgrep to write arbitrary files on the system.
## Remediation
Upgrade `Debian:10` `gzip` to version 1.9-3+deb10u1 or higher.

**_Note:_** _Versions mentioned in the description apply to the upstream `krb5` package._

An issue was discovered in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.16. There is a variable &#34;dbentry-&gt;n_key_data&#34; in kadmin/dbutil/dump.c that can store 16-bit data but unknowingly the developer has assigned a &#34;u4&#34; variable to it, which is for 32-bit data. An attacker can use this vulnerability to affect other artifacts of the database as we know that a Kerberos database dump file contains trusted data.
## Remediation
There is no fixed version for `Debian:10` `krb5`.

**_Note:_** _Versions mentioned in the description apply to the upstream `libidn2` package._

GNU libidn2 before 2.2.0 fails to perform the roundtrip checks specified in RFC3490 Section 4.2 when converting A-labels to U-labels. This makes it possible in some circumstances for one domain to impersonate another. By creating a malicious domain that matches a target domain except for the inclusion of certain punycoded Unicode characters (that would be discarded when converted first to a Unicode label and then back to an ASCII label), arbitrary domains can be impersonated.

**_Note:_** _Versions mentioned in the description apply to the upstream `nghttp2` package._

In nghttp2 before version 1.41.0, the overly large HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame payload causes denial of service.

"openssl","low","low","1.1.1n-0+deb10u1",,false,"## NVD Description
**_Note:_** _Versions mentioned in the description apply to the upstream `openssl` package._

OpenSSL 0.9.8i on the Gaisler Research LEON3 SoC on the Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA uses a Fixed Width Exponentiation (FWE) algorithm for certain signature calculations, and does not verify the signature before providing it to a caller, which makes it easier for physically proximate attackers to determine the private key via a modified supply voltage for the microprocessor, related to a &#34;fault-based attack.&#34;
## Remediation
There is no fixed version for `Debian:10` `openssl`.

"shadow","low","low","1:4.5-1.1",,false,"## NVD Description
**_Note:_** _Versions mentioned in the description apply to the upstream `shadow` package._

shadow 4.8, in certain circumstances affecting at least Gentoo, Arch Linux, and Void Linux, allows local users to obtain root access because setuid programs are misconfigured. Specifically, this affects shadow 4.8 when compiled using --with-libpam but without explicitly passing --disable-account-tools-setuid, and without a PAM configuration suitable for use with setuid account management tools. This combination leads to account management tools (groupadd, groupdel, groupmod, useradd, userdel, usermod) that can easily be used by unprivileged local users to escalate privileges to root in multiple ways. This issue became much more relevant in approximately December 2019 when an unrelated bug was fixed (i.e., the chmod calls to suidusbins were fixed in the upstream Makefile which is now included in the release version 4.8).
## Remediation
There is no fixed version for `Debian:10` `shadow`.

"util-linux","low","low","2.33.1-0.1",,false,"## NVD Description
**_Note:_** _Versions mentioned in the description apply to the upstream `util-linux` package._

A flaw was found in the util-linux chfn and chsh utilities when compiled with Readline support. The Readline library uses an &#34;INPUTRC&#34; environment variable to get a path to the library config file. When the library cannot parse the specified file, it prints an error message containing data from the file. This flaw allows an unprivileged user to read root-owned files, potentially leading to privilege escalation. This flaw affects util-linux versions prior to 2.37.4.

There is no fixed version for `Debian:10` `util-linux`.

"xz-utils","high","high","5.2.4-1",,false,"## NVD Description
**_Note:_** _Versions mentioned in the description apply to the upstream `xz-utils` package._
_See `How to fix?` for `Debian:10` relevant versions._

An arbitrary file write vulnerability was found in GNU gzip&#39;s zgrep utility. When zgrep is applied on the attacker&#39;s chosen file name (for example, a crafted file name), this can overwrite an attacker&#39;s content to an arbitrary attacker-selected file. This flaw occurs due to insufficient validation when processing filenames with two or more newlines where selected content and the target file names are embedded in crafted multi-line file names. This flaw allows a remote, low privileged attacker to force zgrep to write arbitrary files on the system.
## Remediation
Upgrade `Debian:10` `xz-utils` to version 5.2.4-1+deb10u1 or higher.

zlib through 1.2.12 has a heap-based buffer over-read or buffer overflow in inflate in inflate.c via a large gzip header extra field. NOTE: only applications that call inflateGetHeader are affected. Some common applications bundle the affected zlib source code but may be unable to call inflateGetHeader (e.g., see the nodejs/node reference).
